# Biome-Detector
This addon sends the name of the biome you are in to the action bar.
If you use a feather on a block or an entity, you will get the biome id of that block or entity in chat.

## Features
- This addon uses no experimental featrures. It's completely stable.
- This addon doesn't use the player.json entity file. So it's compatible with most addons.
- This addon doesn't use a resource pack. It is simple to install for quick testing.

## Commands
(The detector can be toggled on or off per player, and it's active by default)
To disable: `/scriptevent biome:read false`
To enable: `/scriptevent biome:read true`

To uninstall this addon from your world without a trace, make sure to activate it before leaving.

If you want to use the functions of this addon in your addons for reading the biome, please make sure to credit me.
